# Pairing Project No. 4

## The Plan

In the middle of this lesson's tasks, your responsibilities will pivot. Whomever starts as the driver will switch and become the navigator where the lesson specifies. And vice versa.

Before you start, acquire your designated project repo from the course instructor.

# HTML review and transition to Ruby

## Objectives

* HTML review
* Practice `git`
* Learn about upticks in `Markdown`
* Explain Ruby methods

## 'Git' your updated version

Utilizing instructions from the previous pairing labs, update your local version of the specified repo with the most recent changes.

## Upticks

We learned in the first lab that `Markdown` is a *markup* language. One cool character in `Markdown` is the uptick:

```
`
```

Upticks are compiled down into HTML `<code>` elements. The use of single upticks looks like `this`. However, if you use 3 consecutive upticks, the code snippet gets it's own line. Like so:

```ruby
puts "Hello upticks!"
```

## Instructions

1. Create a new git branch for your work
1. On the `index.html`, below student divs, create an ordered list of your's and your partner's 3 favorite foods
1. Pick your absolute favorite food and add a picture of it to the bottom of the page
1. Wrap the img in a link to a website devoted to your food
1. Format and style this list, img, and link so it appears tidy
1. Add, commit, and push your work
1. Open a PR with a screenshot of your new food section

## Switch drivers

1. Create a new git branch for your work
1. Delete the contents of the README.md and give it a new H1 of "My 4 Favorite Ruby methods"
1. Each of these 4 methods should be from different Ruby Classes
1. Give each ruby method an H3 with the method's name, surrounding it in single upticks
1. Below each method, define the method in your own words
1. Below each definition, use 3 upticks to show an example of the methods use. Feel free to use Ruby comments in your code snippet to make its application very clear - `# this is a comment example`. Specifying the programing language after the first 3 upticks lets Github know to use color styling.
1. Add, commit, and push your work
1. Open a PR with a screenshot of your 4 favorite Ruby methods
