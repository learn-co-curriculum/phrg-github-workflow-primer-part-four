# Pairing Project No. 4

## The Plan

This pairing lesson will pivot team member responsibilities in the middle the lesson's tasks. Whomever starts as the driver will switch and become the navigator where the lesson specifies. And vice versa.

Before you start, acquire your designated project repo from the course instructor.

# HTML review and transition to Ruby

## Objectives

* HTML review
* Practice `git`
* Learn about upticks in `Markdown`
* Explain Ruby methods

## 'Git' your updated version

Utilizing instructions from the previous pairing labs, update your local version of the specified repo with the most recent changes.

## Upticks

We learned in the first lab that `Markdown` is a *markup* language. One cool character in `Markdown` is the uptick:

```
`
```

Upticks are compiled down into HTML `<code>` elements. The use of single upticks looks like `this`. However, if you use 3 consecutive upticks, the code snippet gets it's own line. Like so:

```ruby
puts "Hello upticks!"
```
